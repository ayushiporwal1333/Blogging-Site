			<h4>Choose a Good Topic</h4>
			<p>The first step towards writing a blog post is to pick a good topic. You’ll need to find out what your followers want to know and read about, so your post will continue to get traffic after it’s published.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<h4>Do Your Research</h4>
			<p>Once you have your idea, make sure to research the front page of Google and your main competitors at this stage to see how you can improve on what’s out there. If you can’t write a high quality post that’s better than theirs, don’t bother! You don’t need to be an expert on the topic, but you do need to do your research to make sure you’re adding value.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<h4>Take Notes and Start an Outline</h4>
			<p>While you do your research keep a notebook handy where you can take down the important points and outline your topic. Okay, if not a notebook at least keeps a Google doc tab open. I like using Google docs because, unlike using a notebook, I don’t have to bother about losing it.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<h4>Start Drafting Your Blog Post</h4>
			<p>Now that you have the outline, you can sit down to write your post. I generally like drafting it directly on my WordPress dashboard. It saves a lot of time and extra effort if I don’t have to copy and paste it from somewhere else later.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<h4>Hook Your Readers With a Great Opening</h4>
			<p>If you can hook your readers with a good opening consider half your work to be done. Because if your introduction is boring, people wouldn’t bother to read the rest.Many writers find it easier to write the body of the blog post first, and save writing the intro for last. A good way to write a great introduction is to pose a question addressing the reader’s problem. Then you can tell them how reading your post can help them tackle it. This is a great way to grab your readers’ attention, and they’ll definitely want to read it till the end in the hope of finding the solution.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<h4>Write Like You Talk</h4>
			<p>Don’t overlook the style and tone of your writing. Both these elements can make a big difference. Writing like you’re talking to your reader can make them feel like they’re having a conversation with someone, rather than actually reading a post.</p>
