			<h4>Not knowing your Audience</h4>
			<p>The first common mistakes that new bloggers make is that they do not know the people they are writing for. You must know your readers and what they want or what they are looking for. For example, if you are giving them the information that they want. One should know the intention of your audience and accordingly, write for them. You must know if you are writing for the world or writing for a specific area or region. You should have a strategy all planned out for your blogs to target the right audience. This is a common mistake that you have to keep away from. </p>

			<h4>Not searching popular topics</h4>
			<p>As a beginner, you must be in touch with the current trends in the industry or in your niche. You must know what is viral or what the majority of people are searching in search engines. To get what’s popular, you can use tools like Buzzsumo or Google Trends. These platforms will get you in touch with what most people are looking for. </p>

			<h4>Being Inconsistent</h4>
			<p>In the blogging industry, you can’t be inconsistent with blogs. It could lower your traffic and audience. People want content regularly. As a beginner, you must write 3 to 4 blogs per week. This will keep you in competition and your audience would come again and again to you for more blogs. Consistency is the key to success in blogging.</p>

			<h4>Using long boring paragraphs</h4>
			<p>Most bloggers use long paragraphs and do not use heading and subheadings. This makes it hard for readers to read that content. Readers prefer to read short paragraphs. Dividing your blog into headings and subheading makes it easier for readers to go through the whole content easily as well as google crawler. You should use short paragraphs and divide your blog into parts for a better reading experience. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<h4>Not using conversational language</h4>
			<p>The tone and language of your content matter. People should not feel like they are reading a book while reading your blog. Your language should be conversational like you are talking with your audience. You can not use heavy words or long words that people need to look into a dictionary. Your blog should have simple words with a good conversational tone. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<h4>Sacrifice Quality for Quantity</h4>
			<p>Long content is the key for good ranking but at the same time, you must maintain the quality and relevancy of your content. You can not compromise the quality of your blog over quantity. Quality is what matters everywhere and it is no secret. So, keep the quality of your content for good results. </p>
